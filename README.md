## 🕹️ Working

1. SSL Certificate.domain Checker 
2. Web Processing and Fetching domain details using api.go
3. Neural Network Predictions
4. Caching Recorded Data and Storing into our databases using Go to avoid inefficiency 
5. Hosting a Dynamic And efficient web app using Docker from images of our server.
6. We can get a Popup about Inauthentic Websites through the JavaScript. 

## 🚩 Motivation

CyberSecurity is a big issue , with increasing number of websites who could potentially steal your data and aren't verified, these websites are not certified and/or possibly have a risk of malicious activities , these could possibly ruin your experience on the internet .
It deals with a huge amount of Loses in businesses upto 10.3 Million Dollars a year

## ✎ Future Plans

1.Improving Accuracy of Results
We can set a more complex algorithm to make a even more accurate prediction of authenticity 

2.Robust and More Active Parameters and Model Training
Models can be trained with Large dataset on better parameters can be set by us and fetched by us through apu.go
